Use Monte Carlo Simulation and Lattices to price financial derivatives.

# Instructions:
Monte Carlo Simulation:
 - Run "python main.py" from the monteCarlo folder
 - Outputs price and 95% confidence range for each european option and American put option
 - Generates price simulation graphs as "european_prices.png" and "american_prices.png"
 - Parameters can be changed in main.py

Lattice approach:
 - Run "python main.py" from the lattice folder
 - Outputs price for each european option and American put option
 - Plots the exercisng boudary for American put option 
 - Plots the stopping time distribution for American put option
 - Parameters can be changed in main.py
